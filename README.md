# Deep_Learning_Telecom
Few tps that I have done for my class of Deep Learning at Telecom/Eurecom in 2016.

First TP:
Create a neural network for hand-written digits recognition

Second TP:
Create a convolution neural network to improve the accuracy for hand-written digits recognition.

Third TP:
Create a recurrent neural network to predict the next work using a short sample story.

I would have liked to renovate it but I do not have access to the servers of Eurecom and my computer is not enough powerful to compute it.
